## Applications



## Resources

### Libraries

- [Robot Operating System (ROS)](http://wiki.ros.org/micros_swarm_framework) is a flexible framework for writing robot software.
- [ARGoS](https://www.argos-sim.info/), a multi-physics robot simulator. It can simulate large-scale swarms of robots of any kind efficiently.
- [RCPPSW](https://github.com/swarm-robotics/rcppsw), a collection of reusable C++ software for multi-agent robots research (design patterns, boost gaps, etc.).
- [Awesome Robotics](http://jslee02.github.io/awesome-robotics-libraries/): Simulators, Robot modeling, robot platforms, optimization, motion planning & control, dynamics simulations, ...
